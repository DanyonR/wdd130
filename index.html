                <p>Hello all! My name is pronounced like "canyon", except with a "D" in front. I have had a hobby of building and fixing computers for ten years, and I have wanted to get into an IT career for a long time. I decided to go the software development route because it has always fascinated me, and I have always wanted to know how to do it like the pros. This web development course has given me opportunities to use my artistic and creative skills, which is something that I greatly enjoy. My wife and I have been married for over two years now, and we have no children together. We love traveling and spending all the time we can get together. She has had the dream of becoming a full-time homemaker for many years. My hope is that my education will help her realize that dream. Although we cannot afford either option right now, we would love to own acreage where we can grow our own food, or an RV that we can live like nomads in. </p>

                <p>The United States national government is a federal presidential constitutional republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches of government: legislative, executive, and judicial; this governmental structure is designed to maintain a system of checks and balances among the branches. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. - Wikipedia</p>
