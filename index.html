            <p>Hello all! My name is pronounced like "canyon", except with a "D" in front. I have had a hobby of building and fixing computers for ten years, and I have wanted to get into an IT career for a long time. I decided to go the software development route because it has always fascinated me, and I have always wanted to know how to do it like the pros. My wife and I have been married for over two years now, and we have no children together. We love traveling and spending all the time we can get together. She has had the dream of becoming a full-time homemaker for many years. My hope is that my education will help her realize that dream.</p>
